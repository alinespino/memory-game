### Instructions


The application renders different images to the screen and keeps track of the user's score. Score will increment when user clicks an image for the first time and will reset to 0 if the image is clicked more than once.
Images will shuffle in a random order each time an image is clicked.

Once user's score is reset after an incorrect guess game will restart.
